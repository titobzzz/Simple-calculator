**#The simple calculator**

The simple calculator was built using HTML, css, vanila javascript and webpack for future enhancement if needed.

**What the simple calculator does**
-Arithemtic calculations 
If A and B are random number then the opration 
- A + B  will give the sum of A and B 
- A - B  will give the subtraction of B from A 
- A X B  will give the multiplication of A from B
- A ÷ B  will give the division of A by B
- A % B  will give the reminder(modulus) of B divided by A
- A ± or B ± will give the opposite sign of B or A 
- AC will clear the Screen of the calculator

**Other feature**
Algorithm to add commas rightly even when decimals are included 

**Reason for using stack tools**

**HTML and vanilla JS over React JSX**
It is a single page application with only a few tags in it body and just one Javascript file. there is no need to make a whole react app for it since there are no dynamic rendering or reusable components. This makes the task more light weighted and stress free in development and production.

**Plain CSS over tailwind**
tailwind is my most go to css framework or even scss but instead of installing webpack pluggins for SCSS which i acn import in  my JS file , but because my project is small and lightweight, I choose the plain old CSS which works directly in my HTML file 

**Trade of**
- I would add a delete button(but i had to follo the exhact UI given)
- Remove the ± button because It gave me  alot of issues before i even knew what it was meant for
-Added a better UI component for toggling themes
- some of the Color given weren't the same as the UI given
